# 1.1 About Developer Secrets

What are "developer secrets", and why should you care? Developer secrets are anything about an application a developer wants to keep secret, such as passwords, API keys, and SSH keys. They are sensitive bits of information that should not be commited to code, but are required on boot of your application to make it properly run.
