# dotenv-vault

Dotenv Vault extends the proven & trusted foundation of [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), adding new standards <strong>.env.me</strong> and <strong>.env.vault</strong>. Together, these new standards let you sync and deploy your .env files â€“ quickly & securely. Stop sharing them over insecure channels like Slack and email, and never lose an important .env file again. All from the same people that pioneered dotenv.

## Install

```bash
# install locally (recommended)
npm install dotenv-vault --save
```

## Usage

Dotenv Vault extends `.env` so a much of this will purposely be familiar with a few new commands to learn.

* `.env` holds your project's development secrets. It should NEVER be committed to code.
* `.env.me` authenticates you to sync your .env file. It should NEVER be committed to code.
* `.env.vault` is a local encrypted vault of your secrets across all environments. It can and SHOULD be committed safely to code.

### Setup .env

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```dosini
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
```

As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv-vault:

```javascript
require('dotenv-vault').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it working
```

That's it. `process.env` now has the keys and values you defined in your `.env` file:

```javascript
require('dotenv-vault').config()

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
```

For the next steps, you will need your own [Dotenv Account](https://dotenv.org/signup).

### Set up .env.me & .env.vault

Usage is similar to git. Run the command:

```bash
npx dotenv-vault new
```

Follow those instructions and then run:

```bash
npx dotenv-vault login
```

Then run push and pull:

```bash
npx dotenv-vault push
npx dotenv-vault pull
```

Great! You just synced your .env file. Commit your `.env.vault` file to code, and tell your teammates to run `npx dotenv-vault pull`.

## Manage Environments

Dotenv Vault comes with 4 environments by default - development, ci, staging, and production.

You can push and pull from these environments as well.

Let's set up your production environment.

```bash
npx dotenv-vault open production
```

Edit the values and save.

## Deploy

You need to fully set up your .env.vault file next. Run the command:

```bash
npx dotenv-vault build
```

```bash
npx dotenv-vault buildkeys
```

That's it!

## Documentation

Dotenv Vault, just like Dotenv, exposes two functions:

* `config`
* `parse`

### Config

`config` will read and decrypt your `.env.vault` file, parse the contents, assign it to
[`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env),
and return an Object with a `parsed` key containing the loaded content or an `error` key if it failed.

This happens of `DOTENV_KEY` is set. If `DOTENV_KEY` is not set, `config` fallsback to reading your `.env` file.

```js
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
```

You can additionally, pass options to `config`.

#### Options

##### Path

COMING SOON!

Default: `path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')`

Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.

```js
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
```

##### Encoding

COMING SOON!

Default: `utf8`

Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.

```js
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
```

##### Debug

Default: `false`

Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.

```js
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
```

##### Override

Default: `false`

Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file.

```js
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
```

### Parse

The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.

```js
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
```

#### Options

##### Debug

Default: `false`

Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.

```js
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
```
